            <main>The truth is there is not a singlular correct answer to the philosophy in life,
                in fact, in anything in life. There are so many different perspectives on every single philosophical 
                subject that one needs to be open minded to listen and comprehend the different routes.</main>

                <p><span>Life</span> is a journey, yet each person's roadmap is unique regardless of one's starting point.

            <div class="div-2">
                <p><span>Life</span> can sometimes be so scary that you don't want to take another step forward, yet, if you take a deep breath and let things sink in, you will realize you 
                don't want things to end just yet.
            </div></p>
            <div class="div-3">
                <p><span>Life</span> is beautiful, we just need to embrance everything we are blessed with and accept things that are lesser goods.

            <footer><p>It's really hard to remember this, especially at the time in need, to take a step back and breathe, so this is <span class="closer"> your reminder</span>.</footer></p>
